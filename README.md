# CSV-RoundUps

## Overview

CSV-RoundUps is a Python script designed to help you automatically "round up" your transactions from bank or credit card statements stored in CSV format. Inspired by services like Acorns and Stash, this tool provides an easy way to save or invest spare change from everyday purchases. The script rounds each transaction amount to the nearest dollar and calculates the total difference, which can then be used for investment or saving purposes.

## Key Features

- **Transaction Rounding**: Rounds each transaction to the nearest dollar, calculating the total rounded-up value.
- **CSV Compatibility**: Works with CSV files containing your bank or credit card transaction data.
- **Directory Processing**: If a directory is provided, the script will process all CSV files within that directory, making it easy to handle multiple files.
- **Simple Setup**: Just input the path to your CSV file or directory, and let the script handle the rest.
  
## Motivation

Many people want to save or invest their spare change but don't want to deal with the hassle of manually tracking each transaction. This script automates the process of rounding up all transactions and calculates how much you can save or invest by simply rounding to the nearest dollar. Whether you're looking to automate your savings or just want an easy way to handle small change, CSV-RoundUps makes it quick and simple.
